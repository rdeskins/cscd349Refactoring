# cscd349Refactoring
A text based RPG written in Java that generates enemies for the player character to fight. This was a group project for CSCD 349 - Design Patterns at Eastern Washington University. For this assignment, we started with code given to us by Professor Tom Capaul that he wrote in 2001 and refactored it.

## Getting Started
Download Java, compile the files, and run Dungeon.java
